# Example Codes for "Associations between non-optimum temperatures and cardiovascular hospital admissions and effect modification by ambient particulate air pollution: a two-stage time-series study in China "
## Overview
Example codes and test data for the main analysis of the paper "Associations between non-optimum temperatures and cardiovascular hospital admissions and effect modification by ambient particulate air pollution: a two-stage time-series study in China "
Note: The health insurance data analyzed in this study are regulated by governmental policies and cannot be made available to the public due to privacy reasons. Thus, we generate a fake dataset as  an example, the results are not consistent with the main findings of the paper.

## Software details
R Software, version 4.3.0

## Instructions to use data
1. "test_data_fin.csv" is the fake dataset contains hospital admissions for total major cardiovascular events, daily mean temperautre and ambient air polllution at lag01 from 5 cities during 2017-01-01-2017-12-31.

## Instructions to use code
1. Necessary packages are provided in the codes, please first install the packages.
2. The shared codes are used to generate the main analysis of the paperm, including the associations between non-optimum temperatures and hospital admissions as well as the effect modification by ambient air pollution.
3. The codes are generated to estimate the hosptial admission risks for total major cardiovascular events associated with short-term exposure to non-optimum temperatures. The same code can be used (by changing the dataset of other cause-specific hospital admissions) to develop the results for other subtypes.
